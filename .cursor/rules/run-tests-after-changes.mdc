# Run tests after changes

After making or editing code in `app/` or `tests/`, run the test suite to confirm nothing is broken:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Run from the project root with the virtualenv activated (e.g. `source .venv/bin/activate`). If any test fails, fix the cause before considering the change complete.
